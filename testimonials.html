						<p>Dear Terry and Karen,
						I just wanted to say a big thank you for having the Mobile Ark to attend this years show.  We had a fantastic weekend. 
						It seemed to be another busy 3 days, as was last years!  We brought our wallaby along this year and she proved to be a 
						favourite for most people, along with the other animals - rabbits, guineas, chicks, ducks, hedgehog, tortoises,etc! 
						The evening entertainment was great fun, and the whole show proved to be up to its usual standards of excellent 
						organisation and great range of stalls and facilities.
						I would very much be interested in taking a stand at next years show, so please book us in for Rudgwick 2010!!
						Well done on another successful show this year and many thanks again.</br>
						Regards.</p>

						<p>Hi Terry and Karen,                          
						Just a quick line to say thanks for a brilliant and well organized show.
						We raised £198-31 for the British Heart Foundation.
						We had loads of nice comments about our display; plus had a good time.
						Shame that I did not meet you both but I know that you were very busy.
						Once again many thanks for having us.</br>
						Kind regards</p>

						<p>I am a professional trader and I attended your 
						Rudgwick Country Show as all the shows were all
						cancelled in my area due to bad weather.  I was
						delighted with the crowds and have to say it was
						my best takings for the year. I would like to come
						back next year and go near the craft marquee if
						possible. I Liked the way it was set out over the
						six fields as did my wife, she and kids spend much
						of the time around there.  </p>

						<p>Dear Committee,
						I would like to say on behalf of my family how much we all enjoyed your show on the Sunday of the August bank holiday 2006. 
						It was the first time that we had ventured out to such an event, thinking it was just old steam rollers. As townies we were quite
						surprised to see such a fantastic display of just about everything one could wish to see, in fact I don't think we managed to see
						everything as there was so much on display. Having lost half of the family somewhere on the site I found my way to the beer tent where 
						I thoroughly enjoyed the musical band and a glass or two of ale.
						A superb time was had by all, thank you. </br>
						See you next year!</p>
